# Pet-Simulation

This program was created by Tess (Therese) Ritter and Freyja Feeney. This was done using C++ for our class at UVM. We used command line, python, html, and C++ for this project. We created a pet simulation program that allowed users to adopt pets based on budgets and spend money on food, accessory, and toys. The time period of owning pet(s) is 10 days, and at the end they are set free. While this program does work there are many bugs which don't accurately represent data, or display the wrong output.
