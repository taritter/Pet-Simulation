Welcome to our module 3 open ended project! This program is a virtual pet raising simulator, where the user inherits a garden/home
and is asked to raised and rehabilitate animals from three imaginary species. The user can adopt a pet every other day and view 
those that are being rehabilitated in their homes. There are parallel vectors that keep track of each pets progress/growth, and 
notify the program of when to "release" each animal (based on their own specific rehabilitation times). The program has a budgeting aspect,
where the budgets for different pet-care categories is tracked over the course of the ten day program. This data is written to a file, pet_expenses.txt,
and then the Python program makes a graph of the budget and spending using the data from this file. 

Module 3 concepts:
We used C++ as the main language, and Python and PHP as other programming languages. For non-programming languages we used css and html.

Known Bugs:
Our php has a bug where on the website, when you use the drop-down menu, our image doesn't display on the following page.
When we write to a text file, everything doesn't updates automatically, you have to manually add it through clion by clicking the blue section (merge it).

Future Work:
We can add graphics and animations for the creatures! We also plan to add hunger and happiness levels for each of the animals, as well as 
the ability to name your pets (this will make the experience more immersive). 

Grade Earned:
Main Program complexity and usability: 40 points - the main program is robust and has many functions/is the center of the game
Other programming language: 35/40 - our python program reads file and graphs the data, and our php adds functionality to our website but doesn't work entirely correctly
Other non-programming: 20 - we used html and css in designing our beastiary website and it functions as planned
Commandline Arguments: 2 - we ran the python program to create the graph and used the CLI to update website files 
Style and documentation: -0 - we documented all our header files/methods
video: -0 : we included a video 

Based on this we believe we earned around a 97

To Run:
1. Your graph will be created, then check up on your process by continuing playing the game
2. Open terminal and run Budgeting.py
